## Introduction

This is a website aimed at Chinese international students, to help them meet people and make friends in a new culture and environment. 

Research shows that international students feel socially isolated due to loss of networks and cultural differences. 
This is associated with depressive and anxious symptoms, so we hope to make it less likely that Chinese students will 
develop these conditions by providing a simple platform to meet friends and build community.

### The current state is iteration 1 of the build
